            Hairs are one of the most beautiful gifts from God to mankind. They not only help in maintaining the body temperature
            but also make us look and feel gorgeous and confident. Losing hair is undoubtedly heart wrenching. And losing hair at an
            early age affects self-confidence, personality and may lead to stress and depression. Many doctors may have claimed to
            bring back your hair through various unheard means but all in vain. In our clinic, we do not claim we create hair-full
            heads. From Medication, PRP, Mesotherapy to Hair Transplant, we do it all for various needs of patients.

            MESOTHERAPY
        </div>
        <div class="deta">
            <div class="cause">
                Mesotherapy is a non-surgical cosmetic method of treating thinning of hair and hair fall. In this process superficial
                microinjections are administered just below the uppermost layer of the scalp, called the epidermal layer, which
                stimulates the mesoderm layer in the skin tissues (it is situated at the depth of 1mm approximately), which encourage
                the hair’s growth and regeneration process. Recently, mesotherapy has been gaining popularity among the patients as it
                is highly successful and has effective results, both among men and women experiencing hair loss and balding.
                <br>
                The main highlights of the treatment are that it is based on the concept that the problems of hair loss are because of
                lack of proper nutrients and minerals/Vitamins, which gradually reduces the circulation of blood in the scalp area
                causing hormonal imbalances in the follicle, resulting in an excess production of hair loss androgen.

                <br><br><br>
                <h4><strong><u>How it is done and how much time it takes?
                    </u></strong> </h4><br>
                The treatment contains a solution of active ingredients, Acetyl tetrapeptide-3 and Biochanin- A which work together to
                stimulate natural hair growth. Also, minerals, amino acids, vitamins, enzymes and nucleic acids, can be mixed into
                different proportions and can be customized according to the patients’ requirements. And, after the solution is injected
                it acts by restoring the hormonal imbalances and thus gradually decreases the hair loss and restores the natural hair.
                The treatment procedure varies from patient to patient, however a session usually takes between approximately 15 to 30
                minutes, depending upon the size of the area of treatment.
                <br><br>
                An average minimum of 10 sessions are required in order to create the conditions in the scalp required to stimulate hair
                growth, beginning with an intensive course of treatments every 2 weeks for the first few months, after which it is then
                decreased in frequency to once every 3 months or less.
                <br><br>Mesotherapy works by dual action of chemical and mechanical stimulation in the affected area of hair loss. The chemical
                action of ingredients administered stimulates response in the mesoderm. Whereas in mechanical action the needle which is
                used to inject the solution develops micro perforations in the tissues, thus inducing a healing leading to the
                production of elastin and collagen, which are used to grow hair. <br><br>
                The ingredients in the solution actively work together for faster hair growth by improving blood circulation,
                stimulating production of collagen, reducing inflammation, and increasing the follicle size to stop hair loss.
                    <br><br><br>
                    <h4><strong><u>What to expect?
                            </u></strong> </h4><br>
                            Mesotherapy can potentially eliminate the need for hair transplant or implant surgery.
                            <br><br>
                            Considerable change starts to reflect once the therapy is over, and the baldness might be the issue of the past. But,
                            the result also depends upon the quality of hair and follicle cells.

                            <br>Note– When the mesotherapy is performed under the treatment of an expert it is very safe and painless. Also, there is no
                            need of dressing of skin or injecting anaesthesia.

            Low Laser Light Therapy for Hair Loss Treatmen
        </div>
        <div class="deta">
            <div class="cause">
                Laser light therapy or sometimes referred to as low-level laser therapy stimulates hair growth as well as prevents
                future hair loss even after stopping the treatment. Laser light therapy is low level exposure to near infrared
                radiation. The therapy involves placing the scalp (areas to be treated) under infrared-emitting laser diodes.
                    <br><br>
                Conventionally laser therapy is used to permanently remove body hair. But paradoxically, it can also accelerate hair
                follicle proliferation in humans depending upon the wavelength, exposure time, and frequency of exposure.
                <br><br><h4><strong><u>What Type of Balding Does It Treat?
</u></strong></h4><br>
Low laser therapy treats androgenetic alopecia which is a genetic condition that is the most common form of balding
pattern observed in both male and female. People with androgenetic alopecia have a gene that makes them more reactive to
the effects of the androgenic hormone, called Dihydrotestosterone (DHT). DHT grows in the roots of hair follicles and in
genetically more sensitive people it causes hair follicles to decrease in size and gradually follicles become so
inactive and dormant that it stops growing leading to hair loss.
<br><br>
<h4><strong><u>Working of Low Laser Hair Therapy
        </u></strong></h4><br>
        The hair growth happens in three phases namely, anagen phase being the growth phase, followed by catagen phase, called
        the transition phase and the final phase being the Telogen phase. It is in the third phase that the hair becomes dormant
        and stops growing. The low laser therapy works by stimulating the hair follicles and moving them to anagen phase.
        <br><br>
         The therapy works by using a low label infrared light of wavelength 630 to 670 nanometre, as light of this wavelength is
        absorbed by the hair follicles. The light penetrates through the scalp, stimulating the epidermal stem cells, which
        pushes the regeneration of hair follicles. This helps in increase in the flow of blood and stimulates the metabolic
        process necessary for hair growth, thus preventing formation of DHT in the follicles region.
<br><br>
<h4><strong><u>How effective is Laser Light Therapy?
        </u></strong></h4><br>
        The treatment is highly effective in treating weaker and thinner hair follicles making hair stronger and healthier, and
        thus stopping hair loss. The main concern is that it only works when the hair follicle is active, because in dead hair
        follicles there is no hair regeneration. Hence, it is advisable to start the therapy as soon as possible.
<br><br>
<h4><strong><u>Benefits for using low laser therapy
        </u></strong></h4><br>
        <ul>
            <li>No side effects.</li>
            <li>The procedure is painless and less time consuming.</li>
            <li>This therapy can be combined with medication also, for quick results.</li>
            <li>Comparatively less costly, and used for both men and women.</li>

        <div class="page-dub heading">PRP for Hair Loss
</div>
        <div class="deta"><div class="cause">
            Hair loss affects not only elderly rather teens as well as females are equally affected. It is not just a cosmetic
            problem rather it affects the confidence and personality of individuals. This has led to a tremendous increase in the
            demand of Hair transplant and other surgical procedures.If we look back to primitive hair loss treatments, it imbibed a
            lot of pain and discomfort not only for patients but also to treating Doctors. With time, things have gradually evolved
            and today what we have is a revolutionized and new age solution for treating hair loss in every individual that has
            reduced the need of surgical procedures. <br><br>
            This magic is nothing but the idea of platelet rich plasma therapy (PRP). In PRP therapy, plasma is separated from the
            patient's blood. This plasma contains concentrated platelets which are four or five times the normal value. This plasma,
            when injected into the affected areas of the scalp, stimulates cell multiplication and promotes faster healing. It is a
            flexible and innovative process resulting in quicker re-growth of hair and development of thick hair.
            <br><br>
            <h4><strong><u>How does PRP help in Hair Loss?
                    </u></strong></h4><br>
                    There are numerous ways through which PRP work in hair loss. Just to pen down a few:
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Plasma when injected into the scalp, Platelets are activated and they release several growth factors. These growth

                    <h4><strong><u>Does PRP help in all types of Hair Loss?
                            </u></strong></h4><br>
                            PRP therapy for hair loss works for all. However, it works best for the following situations:
                            <ol>
                                <li>When people are in their early stage of hair loss, that is, when thinning has just started without its reciprocal hair
                                growth. </li>
                                <li>When people have active hair follicles however they aren’t producing the required amount of hair from such follicles.</li>
                                <li>When quality of normal hair growth has weakened over time.</li>
                                <li>When loss of hair is a natural event</li>
                                <li>Since loss of hair is also connected to the quality of health and hygiene, hence people must ensure that they are not
                                subject to any ailments or regular medications which can cause hair loss. It is because when hair loss is a direct cause
                                of any such abnormality within the body, methods like PRP won’t yield any result. In such cases, candidates must consult
                                the respective doctor to revive their lost hair. Hence, before dropping in for PRP treatment, patients must make sure
                                that they are fit and healthy.</li>
                                
                            </ol>

                            <h4><strong><u>Advantages of Platelet Rich Plasma for controlling Hair Loss
                                    </u></strong></h4><br>

                                    agony during the treatment. Professionals take extreme care during the procedure and ensure that patients don’t feel any
                                    discomfort in the course of the therapy. <br><br>
                                    Secondly, it’s extremely simple and flexible. As it uses the blood of the candidate, it minimizes risks and hence,
                                    there’s hardly any complications. <br><br>
                                    Thirdly, Recovery period is way quicker. Unlike traditional procedures, people can treat hair loss and return back to
                                    normalcy at the earliest. It’s an outdoor procedure hence no question of overnight stay. <br><br>
