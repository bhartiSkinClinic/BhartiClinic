            The journey of Dr Bharti’s Hair Skin & Laser Clinic began with the aim to bring best and affordable Hair, Skin, Lasers and Cosmetology practices under one roof, and to let it come within the reach of masses who otherwise hold a notion that skin treatment is a costly affair. 
            <br><br>
            We began our journey with a small step starting our first clinic at Vatsalya Polyclinic, Moshi, Pimpri Chinchwad, Maharashtra in 2018. Over the last two years, we catered to thousands of patients in and around Moshi, and we are elated to share that with honest and sincere efforts we were able to reduce the suffering of masses and bring smile and confidence on many faces. This fostered an everlasting impetus to our nurtured motto further strengthening our commitment. And with soaring zeal and belief we took another stride in our evolution and started our new venture Shraddha Skin Clinic at Bhosari, Pune, Maharashtra in 2019 serving with same vigour and valour and to extend our services to cover larger population with easy connectivity and approachability. 
            <br><br>

            At our both centres all Skin and Hair treatments are personally carried out by Dr. Subhash Bharti, a practicing Dermatologist & Cosmetologist who is continuously lending his experience and acumen for last 11 years with perfect blend of scientifically proven state of the art and recent technology to enhance the aesthetic appeal of every patient in need.
